;; this is a spec sheet for practical human, iteration 0
;; using clojure, ring, and whatever other goodies will do the trick
;; like mongodb

specs:

A: posts can be made (blurbs)
  which have unique, short (3-6 char) ids using the characters:
    a b c d e f g h j k m n p q r s t u v w x y z [confusing ones omitted]
    A B C D E F G H J K M N P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
    2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
  (notice: zeros, ones, L's [ells] and i's [eyes] are omitted)

posts have four delineations:
 - minor edits (spelling, spacing) -- although nonconventional language is OK!
  [sometimes the insight is in the irregularity]
 - totally new
 - comments to already-posted blurbs [which have tree-structure arrangements]
 - alternates [blurbs which 'compete' to replace pre-existing blurbs in the article running]

B: user accounts can be requested (login with your e-mail always, password only necessary if you want to post or double-up, upvote, or 'needs-work' something
 B* : figure out ssh secure logins for people who never want to login and always use the same machine.  maybe some super simple pattern matching game just to act as a last-ditch effort against compromised machine access.

C: posts can have tags upon creation, automatically derived tags, tag suggestions, and additional tags added by users with sufficient "trust" which has both a linear (monotonically increasing value) and a relative (0-99) value

D: articles are automagically derived from blurbs, ratings, and tags.

E: sparky, the seminal database of understanding -- to lead to human beneficial Derived Intelligence


pages to create:

/goodhello
/signin
/login

/post/blurb:id
 or /p/b:id

/edit/blurb
 /e/b

/blurb:id
 /b:id

/comment:id
 /c:id

/edit/comment:id
 /e/c:id

/post/comment:b:id (id of the blurb)
 /p/c:b:id

/article:id
 /a:id

/logout
/signout
/exit
/goodbye  [all active pages, meaning: invoking the URL logs you out.]

/global [for the world- and group- overviews]
/local

/cycle [envisioned as a bicycling group, you have an in-group chat/message board but it's really just a pin/and/comment board for blurbs that your group finds]

/switch [changing your cycling team is possible and easy, but is limited to once a week]

(maybe make /user indicies, but it's not really meant for that sort of interacting)

/user (edit basic info about your account, including your e-mail, password, see your own personal stats)

/settings (general settings page)

/revenue [the top ticker can be rented on a 12 min basis .. the current price ranges from $1 to ___, where ___ is whatever the demand blasts it into.  schedule of availability tracks up to 3 months in advance]


 --some potential table arrangements:

blurbs: content, summary-line-short, summary-line-long, rating
 hidden information (not visible to users): authors, people who rated it, what they rated it

users: stores userEmail, current userId, all past userIds and times of change, all ratings (correctness in redundancy)
(and i suppose password hashes for when they're necessary)


articles: simple aggregations of blurbs, their orders

tags: all the different tags [need a min level of trust to make new ones, free to use currently existing ones, also option to "ask" higher trust users to instantiate some for you.]

tag-relatedness: derived by sparky, built up incrementally. typically phase 2 of the project.  article generation being phase 3


//Updated February 4.2015

:split pages into component pieces for enlive.
(pre-header)
(header)

  (leftwrap)
  (blurbpool)
  (briefpool)

(footer stuff)

each component will return a list of enlive-html/emit* strings ... combine them all for a complete html page :D


@TODO: make a simple post page
       play it nicely with monger + mongodb

@TOdo: make user account signup
      
passwordless login (e-mail a secure link) seems to be the best way for now. 
more on passwordless logins in Ze Future!

user inter-behaviors:
              + depth restrictions on comment threads for new users to join.  meaning: if there is a comment thread,
              at first, people can post comments and join 'willy nilly' but after a depth of 3 or 4 perhaps the ability to
              comment is restricted to those "in the conversation" and those with sufficient rep..  i think this is a great idea, as it naturally discourages hijacking of threads and conversations, and more "real talk" can get done.

              funny ideas: users can pay $5 to set their display name.  otherwise it's an automagically generated string, maybe some numbers, maybe some leet speak.  
              

//Updated Feb 17.2015

if the user wants to change their e-mail later, there could be an easy way to re-associate existing user information with the new account -- offer some sort of easy migration link (also verifiable by e-mail)
