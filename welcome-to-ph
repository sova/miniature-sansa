Hello!  Out of all the billions of people and many trillions of bacteria and other organisms on the majestic planet fondly called "Earth," you have been selected to participate in a new web-based knowledge archive known as Practical Human.

You get a super secret special code to enable your account:  ######

There are some simple guidelines to the use of this website:


  Above all, Be kind.
  

  - Simple beautiful poetry,
  
      quotes of cool people,

        practical knowledge,

                 life hacks,

                   + wisdom 
            
                             are encouraged.


You will start the adventure with 17 points.  
   Seventeen points is quite a few, as it enables you to write a new blurb [cost is 10 ponits]
                                                        and make seven new tags [cost 1p each]

When others "verify" tags you have added, you will get one point.

When others vote positively on your posted blurbs, you will get an amount that exceeds 10 points.

Use your points wisely and they will work for you!


We are working on cool rewards for points.  

 With 10,000 points you can purchase an invite for a friend.


Practical Human has three phases planned out in its first incarnation.  You are among the select few who have been chosen to participate in the first phase.  Please treat the experience with the same respect you would give your own creation.
